      <h1>Redkix Terms of Use</h1>
      <p>Thanks for using RedKix! Our Terms cover your use and access to our services, client software ("App(s)") and
        websites ("Services") Our Service is a cloud-based Email and messaging service that interfaces with your
        existing
        e-mail service (e.g. Exchange, Office 365 Google Apps, etc.) and creates a new experience around e-mail
        conversations and collaboration. By using our Services you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, our
        Acceptable
        Use Policy and our Privacy Policy (together: "Terms").</p>
      <p>From time to time things change and we might need to make changes to our Services without notice. Though we
        make
        efforts to make the Services operate smoothly, like in any other service or software we can’t guarantee that we
        will always be uninterrupted, or immune from errors or bugs. We will do all we can to fix things in those cases
        but can’t guarantee this is always possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><i class="icon-01"></i> Your Account</h2>
      <p>Your account ("Account") is automatically created when you sign in to our email Services by using the log-in
        details to your existing email account (i.e. email and password). The best way to keep your account secure is to
        make sure that no other person uses your Account. Our Services are designed for work. We don’t think you employ
        anyone under the age of 13, but just in case you were wondering, we decided to limit the use of the service to
        people 14 and over. So, by using our Services, you are representing that you are over 13 and that you have the
        legal ability to use our Services.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><i class="icon-02"></i> Your use of our Services</h2>
      <p>As long as you comply with the Terms, we grant you a personal, nonexclusive, non-transferable,
        non-sublicensable
        and fully revocable license (i) to download or use the App for your internal, non-commercial, email use and for
        no
        other purpose; and (ii) to access our website.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><i class="icon-03"></i> Intellectual Property</h2>

      <h3>Our Content</h3>
      <p>Our website and App may include content such as videos, text, files, logos, button icons, images, data
        compilations, links, other specialized content, technical data, documentation, know-how, specifications
        materials,
        designs, data, "look and feel", algorithms, source and object code, interface, GUI, interactive features,
        related
        graphics, illustrations, drawings, animations, and other features (“Content”). The Services (including the
        Content) and any intellectual property rights related thereto are owned by us or licensed to us. The Terms do
        not
        grant you any right or interest in our Services, Content or any intellectual right related thereto. If you
        decide
        to share any feedback with us, know that we might actually use it without letting you know. So feel free to
        share
        along!</p>

      <h3>Your Content</h3>
      <p>Our Services store, synchronize and process data from your existing e-mail account, including emails,
        attachments, titles and correspondence history (collectively, "Your Content"). We know this data is sacred and
        we
        treat it as such. We do not claim ownership of Your Content as it’s yours! However, in order to operate our
        Services and perform the actions stated above, we need to be able to store Your Content. So, by signing up you
        are
        giving us and our subsidiaries permission to take these actions. While we do our best to ensure there is no data
        loss, we will have no liability for any loss or damage relating to Your Content in the rare case something might
        happen.
        <br>
        <strong>You are responsible for your conduct, Your Content and you must comply with our Acceptable Use
          Policy.</strong>
      </p>


      <h3>Third Party Components</h3>
      <p>Our services may include certain components which are offered under open source licenses. Your use of such
        components should be in accordance with their open source licenses and not these Terms. We make no
        representation
        regarding such open source components. If an open source license requires us to provide the source code of its
        applicable component, we will provide it to you for a charge of no more than our cost of physically performing
        source distribution.</p>

        THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE, REDKIX'S AND
        REDKIX'S REPRESENTATIVES' TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL DAMAGES OR LOSSES WHATSOEVER ARISING UNDER THE TERMS

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><i class="icon-07"></i> Modifications to the Terms</h2>
      <p>We may revise the Terms from time to time. In case of any material change that reduces your rights, we will
        make
        reasonable efforts to post a clear notice on our website or App, and/or will send you an e-mail (to the extent
        that you provided us with such e-mail address) regarding such change. Such material changes will take effect
        seven
        (7) days after such notice was provided on our website and/or App or sent via e-mail, whichever is the earlier.
        Your continued use of the website and/or App on or after the Last Revised date will constitute acceptance of
        those
        changes. In the event that the Terms should be amended to comply with any legal requirements, the amendments may
        take effect immediately without any prior notice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><i class="icon-08"></i> Termination</h2>
      <p>You are free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or terminate the
        Services at any time at our sole discretion and without notice (for example, if you fail to comply with our
        Acceptable Use Policy). Once your use is terminated (by you or us) your right and license to use our Services
        terminates and you must delete the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><i class="icon-09"></i> Governing Laws</h2>
      <p>Any claim relating to the Terms and Services are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
        State of California, U.S., without reference to its conflict-of-laws principles. The courts of San Francisco or
        Santa Clara, California, shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or related to the
        Terms
        or Services. Notwithstanding, we may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><i class="icon-10"></i> Entire Agreement</h2>
      <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter herein and

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><i class="icon-11"></i> Waiver, Severability, and Assignment</h2>
      <p>Redkix's failure to enforce the Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision is found
        unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, so that these
        Terms
        shall otherwise remain in full force and effect while most nearly adhering to the intent expressed herein. You
        may
        not assign or transfer any right or obligation under these Terms without our prior written consent and any
        attempt
        to do so shall be void. We may assign or transfer these Terms without restriction or notification.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><i class="icon-12"></i> Any Questions</h2>
      <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter herein and
